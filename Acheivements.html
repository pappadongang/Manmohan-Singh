            <b>Economic Liberalization:</b> As Finance Minister in 1991, Dr.
            Singh played a pivotal role in transforming Indiaâ€™s economy. He
            spearheaded the liberalization, privatization, and globalization
            (LPG) policies, which led to the dismantling of the License Raj,
            reduction in trade barriers, and the encouragement of foreign
            investment. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Economic Crisis Management:</b> During India's 1991
            balance-of-payments crisis, he helped stabilize the economy by
            implementing urgent reforms, including devaluing the rupee, reducing
            fiscal deficits, and initiating a series of market-driven economic
            policies.

            <b>Nuclear Deal with the United States:</b> One of Dr. Singh's most
            significant achievements was the signing of the India-US Civil
            Nuclear Agreement in 2008, which allowed India to import nuclear
            technology and fuel despite not being a signatory of the
            Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). <br /><br />
            <b>Strengthened Ties with the US, Russia, and Other Nations:</b> Dr.
            Singh's tenure saw India's foreign relations expand, especially with
            the United States, Russia, and the neighboring countries. India also
            played a more prominent role in international forums such as the G20
            and BRICS.

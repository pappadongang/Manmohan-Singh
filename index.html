      <b>Dr.Manmohan Singh (26 September 1932 – 26 December 2024) </b>was an
      Indian politician, economist, academic, and bureaucrat, who served as the
      13th prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He was the fourth
      longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and
      Narendra Modi. A member of the Indian National Congress, Singh was the
      first Sikh prime minister of India. He was also the first prime minister
      since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year
      term. <br /><br />Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh's family
      migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his
      doctorate in economics from Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations
      during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit
      Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and
      Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the
      Government of India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor
      of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning Commission
      (1985–1987).
